# Allow multiple blank lines
#
# Reason: Sometimes multiple blank lines improve readability, e.g., between sections, or for adding HTML comments to Markdown. ADR templates have this. Also, certain pre-commit hooks add an extra line at the end of a file.

MD012: false

# Allow arbitrary line length
#
# Reason: We apply the one-sentence-per-line rule. A sentence may get longer than 80 characters, especially if links are contained.

MD013: false

# Allow duplicate headings
#
# Reasons:
#
# - The chosen option is considerably often used as title of the ADR. Thus, that title repeats.
# - Markdown lint should support the user and not annoy them.

MD024: false

# Allow misaligned table pipes
#
# Reason: It is more readable to align the pipes in tables, but it is a lot of work to maintain that alignment. Markdown lint should support the user and not annoy them.
# Note: Should it be set to a different setting than `aligned`?
